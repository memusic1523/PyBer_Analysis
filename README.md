# PyBer_Analysis
  Using Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationships between the type of city, number of drivers, and riders.
  System: Python
## Overview of the PyBer Analysis
  - Find the relationship between city types and the number of drivers and riders.
  - Generate the percentage of  total Fare, rides, drivers by the city type.
  - Confirm the the finds in January to May 2019.
  - Generate the relationship between variiables in dataset.
  - Generate the amount of riders and fares are affected by the average number of drivers per city type.
  - Include visualizations to help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services 
  - Determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
  
## PyBer Results
In the data frame, we were given 2 data set that had the amount of fares per city and the the amount of rides per city type. We therefore decided to merge both datasets with the commen column of city types. We were able to create a new dataset to keep the analysis clean. We calculate the total rides by city types: Rural with 125, Suburban with 625, and Urban with 1625. The total drivers for city type is Rural with 78 drivers, Suburban with 490 drivers, and Urban with 2405 drivers. We also calculated the sum fare for each city type is Rural with $4,327.93 with an average of $34.62 fare per ride. Suburban with $19,356.33 with an average of $30.97 fare per ride. Lastly with the majority fares is $39,854.38 with an average of $24.53 fare per ride. We've created a pivot table to filter the amout of fares that took place per date per city type. PyBer wanted to us to analysis the month of January 2019 to May 2019. We were able to find through a dataframe that the majority of the rides were from the Urban city type. With our findings for the months of January 2019 to May 2019, we were able to create a line chart. 

## PyBer Summary
In conclusion, we can see that during the months of January 2019 through May 2019 Urban was having a decline at the end of March while Rural area was incline. As well in the end of the month of February, you can see the their is an incline in all city type. Which makes you wonder as to why there was an incline of fares. Is that the only month where all city types had an incline through the year? In our merge dataset, we can see that Urban city types has the most riders/fares compare to Rural and Suburban. We can look more as to see if we need to improve our driver or fare rate in those area.
